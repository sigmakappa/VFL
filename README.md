File Utilities Tool written in Java 
======================================================

This utility presents the user with a list of redundent video files (in MP4, AVI, DAT, FLV ,MKV , MOV, WMV formats) present in a number of desired directories.

#### Usage:
Required Java 1.8.0 or above.

For running the associated jar, simply navigate to the directory where the jar is placed and run:
```
java -jar VFL.jar
```

### Updates on future releases:
* Currenly supports only Windows and Video files (hence the V in VFL as currently only video files are supported)
* Implement smarter algorithm to check redundency better and bring out more suggestions on redundency.
